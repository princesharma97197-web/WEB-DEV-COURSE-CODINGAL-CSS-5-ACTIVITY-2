    <P>Birds are warm-blooded, feathered vertebrates characterized by wings, beaks, laying hard-shelled eggs, and a high
    metabolism, existing in over 11,000 species globally, from tiny hummingbirds to large ostriches, with adaptations for
    diverse environments like flight, swimming, or running, playing vital ecological roles in seed dispersal, pest control,
    and pollination.</P>
